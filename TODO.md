# TODO

* Consider `[Intersection]` (sorted by list intersection) as newtype
* Consider Ord for Intersect
ion
* Optional: Transformable class, instances for Sphere and Ray
* May submatrix33 from Matrix can be expressed or replaced by _m33?
* Refactor normalAt in Sphere - reduce parentheses count and eliminate explicit V4.vector call
* continued - Consider set w = 0 hack instead of matrix projection
* Consider normalTransform as function in Matrix
